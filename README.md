AI-Driven 3D Model Generation Platform

Project Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-powered platform that generates 3D models from simple text prompts. The platform is designed for a variety of applications such as education (e.g., visualizing physics concepts), architecture, interior design, and AR/VR immersive experiences. By leveraging generative AI, we simplify the 3D content creation process, making it accessible to users of all skill levels.

Key Features

Text-to-3D Model Generation: Users input text prompts to generate 3D models using AI.
Real-Time Interactivity: Users can interact with the generated models, manipulating parameters in real-time.
Physics Simulation: Real-time visualization of physics parameters such as gravity and motion.
AR/VR Integration: Immersive model viewing with AR/VR support.
Marketplace (Future): A platform for buying and selling AI-generated 3D models.

Technology Stack

Frontend: React.js for the user interface and Three.js for 3D model rendering.
Backend: Django for managing requests and interactions between frontend and backend.
AI Models: Generative AI models using Blender and Three.js to convert text into 3D models.
Physics Engine: Matter.js and Cannon.js for real-time physics simulation.
AR/VR Integration: Support for AR/VR headsets for immersive model interaction.
